\section{Introduction}
Our team aims to determine the isotopic composition of kelp, fish, and other sea life along the west coast of the Americas, particularly in the San Francisco Bay and Long Beach, though we will be studying samples from Alaska all the way to Chile. In particular, we would like to see if there are any major differences in isotopes found in samples from different parts of the West Coast, and whether the isotopes found in the different samples will present a toxicity or radiological health hazard to the peoples living along the Pacific.

We will be using neutron activation analysis (NAA) to determine the isotopic composition of our samples. NAA involves irradiating test samples with a high neutron flux in order to activate the isotopes present in the sample. These isotopes then decay, emitting characteristic gamma rays that allow us to identify the isotopes that were originally in the sample. Based on the half-life of the isotope, its branching ratio at a particular gamma energy, and the counts registered on the detector, we can also determine the amount of the isotope in the test sample. NAA provides advantages that other techniques do not. NAA is relatively unobtrusive, and will not cause significant damage to the test sample. As neutrons can penetrate deeply into a material, NAA can be used on bulk samples. These samples do not need the careful preparation that is needed for other techniques to determine isotopic composition. Thus, NAA provides a fairly accurate and precise measurement of isotopic compositions without causing physical damage to the sample, and without the hassle of extended preparation time. With these advantages come some significant disadvantages that we will have to work around. One is that materials activated by neutrons remain radioactive for a long time after irradiation took place. Dependent on the isotopes in the sample, and the half-lives of those isotopes, this can make working with activated materials hazardous. This should not be an overwhelming concern for our team, as the samples that we will be working with are not expected to contain hazardous isotopes in the concentration needed to be harmful to us. Nevertheless, presence of toxic and radiologically active materials should be noted. The other concern is that there are only a select few facilities that have the capabilities needed to perform neutron activation on test samples. Fortunately, the McClellan Nuclear Research Center (MNRC), which is able to perform neutron activation, is relatively close, an advantage that will be crucial to the success of our project.

            



\section{Goals}

Our ultimate goal in this project is to be able to communicate to the public radiological information about things they regularly interact with.  Since the Fukushima incident in 2011, public concern about all things nuclear has dramatically increased.  The air people breathe, the fish they eat, and the bodies of water that surround them can be analyzed radiologically.  Publishing the analysis for people to see creates a more radiologically informed public.  We intend to accomplish this overarching goal by meeting these more specific needs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze recently taken NAA data on kelp from all over the West Coast
\item Obtain new kelp samples, carry out NAA on them at MNRC, and analyze those results
\item Perform NAA measurements on seaweed samples
\item Find new samples to perform NAA and gamma-ray analysis on
\item Compile results and write article(s) on the findings
\item Take important data and articles and publish them to the Radwatch website
\end{itemize}

\section{Timeline}

Figure 1 shows a Gantt chart timeline of the various tasks required for this project. The first task revolves around the existing NAA data. Following the procedure described in the introduction, we must identify the composition of the existing samples

\section{Critical Equipment}
We will be using the following instruments/tools:


\begin{itemize}
\item High Purity Germanium (HPGe) Detector in 1110C
\item PeakEasy 4.81
\item MNRC reactor

Additional equipment will be added to this section as we move along with the project

\end{itemize}


\section{Initial Research}
\subsection{Spectra Analysis}

Figure 2 shows a sample spectra that we have already analyzed. Our initial analysis found the characteristic gamma rays of ${82}$Br and ${24}$Na. This shows that ${81}$Br and ${23}$Na were most likely present in our original sample, and using the neutron flux, neutron capture cross section, counts in peak, and detector efficiency, we can determine the initial composition of ${81}$Br and ${23}$Na in our sample.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ExampleSpectra}
\caption{This figure shows a NAA spectra for sample 1. $^{82}$Br and $^{24}$Na are very prominent in the spectra.}
\end{figure} 

\pagebreak


\subsection{Detector Efficiency Curve}

Figure 3 shows the detector effiency curve for the HPGe detector used in room 1110C. The sources used to generate the efficiency curve were $^{137}$Cs, $^{60}$Co, $^{152}$Eu, $^{22}$Na, and $^{228}$Th. We used a plethora of sources in order to cover a wide range of gamma ray energies and find the efficiency over the entire energy spectrum we will be measuring. Using this efficiency curve, we will be able to determine the inital elemental concentrations of our samples.

\section{Next Steps}
  
Once the isotopic composition of our test samples is known, we can research effects that the radioactive and chemically toxic isotopes can have on peopleâ€™s health and the environment. This will hopefully give a better understanding of how harmful isotopes are transported through the oceans to different locations on the coast, and how we can combat the buildup of hazardous material along the coastline. This is in large part motivated by the Fukushima accident and the radiological release caused by that. Little was known prior to the accident about how radioactive isotopes are carried through the ocean, or how the concentration of these isotopes builds up in sea life. Because of this, the public was misinformed on the radiological impact of the Fukushima accident. This project is, in part, designed to address this misunderstanding. The NAA spectra results we obtain will be compared with the gamma-ray counting experiments performed by the RadWatch team earlier to verify accuracy. With the samples analyzed, and isotopic compositions noted, we can then find other samples of interest and compare the results. These results should give us some insight how the geography of the coast lines and the biology of the test samples chosen affect the isotope concentrations. We will also be able to see what effects human activity have on isotope concentrations, specifically how heavy industry in the Long Beach area contributes to the buildup of radioactive and toxic isotopes in the environment. The important findings from these experiments will be posted on the RadWatch website to assist with their research into radioisotope activity in the oceans. Hopefully, these findings will give some insight into what affects the concentrations of isotopes in ocean going samples, which will allow later teams to devise plans on how to best predict and combat buildup of hazardous materials along the coast.
