\section{Introduction}
Our team aims to determine the isotopic composition, specifically trace metals, of kelp, fish, and other sea life along the west coast of the Americas, particularly in the San Francisco Bay and Long Beach, though we will be studying samples from Alaska all the way to Chile. In particular, we would like to see if there are any major differences in isotopes found in samples from different parts of the West Coast, and whether the isotopes found in the different samples will present a toxicity or radiological health hazard to the peoples living along the Pacific.

We will be using neutron activation analysis (NAA) to determine the isotopic composition of our samples. NAA involves irradiating test samples with a high neutron flux in order to activate the isotopes present in the sample. These isotopes then decay, emitting characteristic gamma rays that allow us to identify the isotopes that were originally in the sample. Based on the half-life of the isotope, its branching ratio at a particular gamma energy, and the counts registered on the detector, we can also determine the amount of the isotope in the test sample. NAA provides advantages that other techniques do not. NAA is relatively unobtrusive, and will not cause significant damage to the test sample. As neutrons can penetrate deeply into a material, NAA can be used on bulk samples. These samples do not need the careful preparation that is needed for other techniques to determine isotopic composition. Thus, NAA provides a fairly accurate and precise measurement of isotopic compositions without causing physical damage to the sample, and without the hassle of extended preparation time. With these advantages come some significant disadvantages that we will have to work around. One is that materials activated by neutrons remain radioactive for a long time after irradiation took place. Dependent on the isotopes in the sample, and the half-lives of those isotopes, this can make working with activated materials hazardous. This should not be an overwhelming concern for our team, as the samples that we will be working with are not expected to contain hazardous isotopes in the concentration needed to be harmful to us. Nevertheless, presence of toxic and radiologically active materials should be noted. The other concern is that there are only a select few facilities that have the capabilities needed to perform neutron activation on test samples. Fortunately, the McClellan Nuclear Research Center (MNRC), which is able to perform neutron activation, is relatively close, an advantage that will be crucial to the success of our project.

            



\section{Goals}

Our ultimate goal in this project is to be able to communicate to the public radiological information about things they regularly interact with.  Since the Fukushima incident in 2011, public concern about all things nuclear has dramatically increased.  The air people breathe, the fish they eat, and the bodies of water that surround them can be analyzed radiologically.  Publishing the analysis for people to see creates a more radiologically informed public.  We intend to accomplish this overarching goal by meeting these more specific needs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze recently taken NAA data on kelp from all over the West Coast
\item Obtain new samples from the bay, carry out NAA on them at MNRC, and analyze those results
\item Perform NAA measurements on seaweed samples

\section{Timeline}

Figure 1 shows a Gantt chart timeline of the various tasks required for this project. The first task revolves around the existing NAA data. Following the procedure described in the introduction, we must identify the composition of the existing samples

\section{Critical Equipment}
We will be using the following instruments/tools:


\begin{itemize}
\item High Purity Germanium (HPGe) Detector in 1110C
\item PeakEasy 4.81
\item MNRC reactor
\item High precision scale
\item Plastic vials for sample preparation



\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detector Efficiency Curve}

Figure 3 shows the detector effiency curve for the HPGe detector used in room 1110C. The sources used to generate the efficiency curve were $^{137}$Cs, $^{60}$Co, $^{152}$Eu, $^{22}$Na, and $^{228}$Th. We used a plethora of sources in order to cover a wide range of gamma ray energies and find the efficiency over the entire energy spectrum we will be measuring. Using this efficiency curve, we will be able to determine the inital elemental concentrations of our samples.

\section{Irradiation Procedure}

\subsection{Sample Preparation}
Before preparing our samples, we decided to determine what new samples to activate. We decided to choose various samples of fish, seaweed, and seashells for analysis. The following list shows the elements expected to be seen in the different samples.

Seaweed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Potassium, Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium and Sulfur
\item Trace amounts of Zinc, Copper, Chlorine, Cobalt, Manganese, Selenium, Bromine, Iron, and Arsenic
\end{itemize}
Seashells:
\begin{itemize}
\item Calcium, Carbon, Oxygen
\end{itemize}
Fish:
\begin{itemize}
\item Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen, Sulfur, and Nitrogen
\item Trace amounts of various metals, such as Sodium, Aluminum, and Iron
\item Looking for Mercury-203 at 279 keV
\end{itemize}


Preparation of the samples for irradiation required two individuals, both wearing latex gloves. One individual handled the weighing of the vial using the high precision scale before and after a sample was placed inside. The other individual used tongs to carefully place each sample into the vial, making sure to not contaminate the outside of the vial to prevent radioactive contamination from forming during irradiation. After all the samples were placed in vials, the vials were soldered shut to ensure that the vials would not open inside the reactor. The vials were then transported to MNRC where the irradiation occurred. 

\subsection{Long Run Procedure}

For the long run, we used samples of fish, seaweed, and seashells in order to diversify our sample data and findings.  Again, after receiving approval from MNRC to perform long run irradiation on our samples, we took the samples to MNRC.  The samples were placed in the NTD position, which has a lower flux, but allows for irradiation at a power level of 1 MW for many hours, as opposed to the PTS.  After waiting a few days for the samples to decay to safe levels, we received the samples in Etcheverry and counted them using the HPGe detector in the 1110C laboratory.

\subsection{Short Run Procedure}
For the short run, we used four samples from the initial set of kelp samples.  After receiving clearance from MNRC to run these samples for a short-lived isotope test, we brought the samples to MNRC.  We put our sample vials inside rabbit tubes, which eventually went in the pneumatic transfer system (PTS).    The PTS is used for the short run, whereas the neutron transmutation doping position (NTD) is used for the long run.  See Figure *insert figure number based on report* for the locations of the PTS and NTD.  We ran the reactor at a power level of 20 kW, for a total of 100 seconds of irradiation. Immediately after the samples decayed to a level safe to handle, MNRC ran counts on the samples up to an hour in length.  



\section{Spectra Analysis}
\subsection{Kelp Long Run Spectra}
Figure 2 shows a sample spectra that we have already analyzed. Our initial analysis found the characteristic gamma rays of ${82}$Br and ${24}$Na. This shows that bromine and sodium were most likely present in our original sample, and using the neutron flux, neutron capture cross section, counts in peak, and detector efficiency, we can determine the initial composition of bromine and sodium in our sample.

\begin{figure}[h]

\section{Data Analysis and Results}
\subsection{Concentration Calculation}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Eq3}}
\caption{This figure shows the orthodox equation used to determine the relative abundance a given element in an unknown sample.}
\end{figure}

The orthodox way to determine relative elemental composition in an unknown sample is given by the equation in figure 4. However, by using standard pottery, we are able to determine the elemental composition of an unknown sample without detector efficiency, irradiation flux, and cross section. Standard pottery is clay pottery which contains a wide range of chemical elements. Using NAA, we can activate the pottery and use it as a chemical fingerprint for many different elements. Many minor components of the pottery are activated via NAA and these component compositions are known to high accuracy, making the standard pottery a valuable tool in determining the composition of an unknown sample. Figure 5 shows the elemental composition of the standard pottery used as part of this project.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{stdpottery}}
\caption{This figure shows the elemental compositions in the standard pottery. These compositions were used in the calculation of the sample compositions}
\end{figure}

The counts per second per gram, or $\frac{cps}{g}$ for a given sample is given by $$\frac{cps}{g} = \frac{N\Phi\sigma(1-e^{-\lambda t})\epsilon \beta_{ \gamma}}{m * LT}$$ where N is number of atoms, $\Phi$ is irradiation flux, $\sigma$ is cross section, $\epsilon$ is detector efficiency, $\beta_{\gamma}$ is branching ratio, LT is live time, and m is sample mass. We can write the activity A of a given sample as $$A=N\Phi\sigma(1-e^{-\lambda t})$$, allowing us to rewrite $\frac{cps}{g}$ of a given sample as $$\frac{cps}{g} = \frac{A\epsilon\beta_{\gamma}}{m*LT}$$ Using a simple ratio between level of sample activation and elemental concentration $\frac{A}{C}$, we can say that $$\frac{\frac{cps}{g}_{sample}|_{t=0}}{C_{sample}} = \frac{\frac{cps}{g}_{pottery}|_{t=0}}{C_{pottery}}$$ Using this ratio, we can calculate the elemental concentration in a given sample with the standard pottery. $$C_{sample} = \frac{\frac{cps}{g}_{sample}|_{t=0} C_{pottery}}{\frac{cps}{g}_{pottery}|_{t=0}}$$

The error associated ratio method for calculating sample concentration can be calculated using the error propagation formula $$\sigma_F^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N (\frac{dF}{dx_i})^2 \sigma_{x_i}^2$$. Expanding this out for the formula given above, we get that the error in concentration can be given by $$\sigma_{C_{sample}}^2 = (\frac{C_{pottery}}{\frac{cps}{g}_{pottery}|_{t=0}})^2\sigma_{\frac{cps}{g}_{sample}}^2 +  (\frac{\frac{cps}{g}_{sample} C_{pottery}}{(\frac{cps}{g}_{pottery})^2})^2|_{t=0}\sigma_{\frac{cps}{g}_{pottery}}^2 +  (\frac{\frac{cps}{g}_{sample}|_{t=0}}{\frac{cps}{g}_{pottery}|_{t=0}})^2\sigma_{C_{pottery}}^2$$

In the event that a characteristic gamma ray peak was not seen in any of the spectra for a given sample, an upper bound was given for the composition. By analyzing the energy region where the peak should be (for example, 1525keV for $^{42}$K), we can determine the error in peak area by taking the square root of counts in the energy reason. By using this as the number of counts, we can propogate a 1$\sigma$ error bound through the composition calculation, giving an upper limit on the elemental conentration.

\subsection{Kelp Sample Short Run Results}
Unfortunately there was a miscommunication with MNRC regarding detector efficiency and binary data. Since we did not take a spectra of the standard pottery on the detectors used at MNRC, we cannot use the ratio method discussed earlier in this report due to the different detector efficiencies. Therefore, we need the efficiency data for the MNRC detectors to calculate the elemental concentration for the short run samples. This was not communicated properly to MNRC and unfortunately we were unable to retrieve the efficiency data prior to the submission of this report. Prior to publishing on the website, the short run data will be analyzed, either by us or students working with RadWatch in the near future.

\subsection{Fish Long Run Results}
Similar tables and bar graphs will be generated to show results for this section.
\subsection{Seaweed Long Run Results}
Similar tables and bar graphs will be generated to show results for this section.
\subsection{Seashell Long Run Results}
Similar tables and bar graphs will be generated to show results for this section.

\section{Conclusion}
This section will include a wrap-up discussion of our results


\section{Future Work}

The important findings from these experiments will be posted on the RadWatch website to assist with their research into radioisotope activity in the oceans. Hopefully, these findings will give some insight into what affects the concentrations of isotopes in ocean going samples, which will allow later teams to devise plans on how to best predict and combat buildup of hazardous materials along the coast. 

Future work that can be done for this project would be to survey other areas that are highly populated and near large harbors. Areas such as New York, Boston would be good locations to perform NAA on sea samples to compare elemental compositions across
